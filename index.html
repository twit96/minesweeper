        Click on a tile to uncover it. Avoid uncovering tiles with mines
        underneath them (your first move will be random). If the tile contains a
        number, it indicates how many mines will be found in the tiles adjacent
        to it. Use these numbers as clues to uncover other safe tiles.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Long press a tile to mark it with a flag if you know a mine is
        underneath it. Once all mines have been found, you have won the game!
      </p> -->
      <p>
        The number in the top left of the screen indicates the number of
        mines to be found. Click this number to change the game difficulty
        (by default, it is set to 'easy').
      </p>
      <p>
        The smiley face button in the top-middle of the screen can be clicked to
        start a new game at any time. Each game board is randomly generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number in the top right is a timer, and does not start until you
        have uncovered your first tile.
